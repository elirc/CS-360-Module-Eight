# CS-360-Module-Eight
The app I developed is an event tracking application, designed to help users discover, plan, and manage their attendance at various events.

 Screens in the app included a dashboard of upcoming events, a detailed event view, and a personal event calendar. Features such as event search, notifications, and updating capabilities also are in the app.

 I approached coding with an agile mindset, breaking down tasks into smaller user stories.

 Testing began with unit tests for individual components, followed by integration tests to evaluate how different parts interacted. 

 
A challenge I had to overcome is integrating every part of the app. I attempted to do this by importing all the needed modules and libraries.

The updating component of my app demonstrated my skills related to CRUD development.
